# 🏗️ AR-Based Crowdsourced Infrastructure Repair Platform  
**PS ID: 9.6 – Municipal SaaS + AR Mapping**

## 📌 Problem Statement
Cities face delays in identifying and repairing damaged infrastructure such as roads, drainage, street lights, and footpaths.  
Current systems are manual, slow, non-transparent, and lack real-time ground-level data.

## 💡 Solution Overview
We built a **full-stack crowdsourced infrastructure repair platform** where:
- Citizens report infrastructure damage using a mobile app
- AR-based mapping helps mark exact damage locations
- Municipal authorities manage, prioritize, and track repairs via a SaaS dashboard

This solution improves **speed, transparency, cost-efficiency, and governance**.
